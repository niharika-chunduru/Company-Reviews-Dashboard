70,83232036,A Regrettable Experience at Tripadvisor,"Lifestyle benefit is a nice perk as well as the company shut down week between Christmas and New Years.I joined Tripadvisor with high hopes and enthusiasm, believing it would be a stepping stone for my career growth. However, my time at the company turned out to be the biggest regret of my professional life.

The company's primary focus appears to be solely on revenue, with little regard for the well-being of its employees or the satisfaction of its customers. The lack of value placed on both internal and external stakeholders is evident in every aspect of the organization.

One of the most glaring issues is the disorganized structure of the company. The communication and updates are shockingly poor, leaving employees in the dark about crucial information. Teams seem to lack passion for the business, resulting in a noticeable lack of desire to excel in their daily tasks.

The leadership team, unfortunately, is both inexperienced and unorganized. Their approach is not only tone-deaf but also sloppy, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued. A striking example of this is the insistence on full-time office attendance while leaders enjoy vacations in exotic locations such as the Bahamas, joining meetings remotely. This stark contrast in expectations and actions highlights the lack of empathy and understanding within the leadership team.

Communication breakdowns are rampant, with emails frequently ignored, and political games playing a significant role in day-to-day operations. This creates an unhealthy work environment, contributing to the overall dissatisfaction among employees.

The benefits package provided by Tripadvisor is severely lacking, causing numerous headaches and troubleshooting efforts. There is a palpable lack of trust in how commissions are calculated and paid out, further eroding confidence in the company's transparency and fairness. In addition their were hidden cliffs with in 401k and RSU options. The limited support given to teams and customers alike underscores the company's lack of commitment to their well-being.

In conclusion, my experience at Tripadvisor has been nothing short of disappointing. This move, which I had initially looked forward to the most in my career, turned out to be a profound letdown. I strongly caution anyone considering employment with or engaging in business with Tripadvisor to think twice. The company's prioritization of revenue over its people and customers, combined with its organizational and leadership issues, make it an undesirable place to work or collaborate with.",neg

The company focus on inclusion is really strong, some leaders dedicating real time to drive this across the culture of the businessThe company can try to move fast for it's size- this can cause a breakdown in communications with a matrixed organisation and parallel teams.

313,19pl3prvoak57d2k,The pros outweigh the cons,"In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""

However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.

Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):
1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...
2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.
3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.
4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. 

Now for the good (and there's a lot):
1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.
2- The pay is competitive-plus.
3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.
4- Chance to work on exciting products. 
5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.
6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.

I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.",neg
314,19phk6oedak579do,"This is an unpaid position, it's voluntary","I love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.",pos
315,19lmfri12akabcs9,Exciting workplace,"I have been working for TripAdvisor for almost three years now and I love the job culture and coming here every day due to the relationship I have with my colleagues and managers. It's a very relaxed place where they provide us with lunch sometimes, and events such as karaoke/pizza's night and drinks in the terrace. I grew so much in this Company, as I started as Customer Support and then they gave me the opportunity to move to the current position in Fraud Support.",neg
316,199ifthj5b84g887,A busy but uneventful and counterproductive workplace,"On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.

Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.

Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.

Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your hard work.
