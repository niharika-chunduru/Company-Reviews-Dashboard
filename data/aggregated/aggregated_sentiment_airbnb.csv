The team spirit and camaraderie among colleagues made it a good place to work, and there were always opportunities to learn and grow within the company.There are a few areas where Airbnb could improve.

24,89382911,Worst company ever,"Salary and nothing more hereThe management here is highly unprofessional and disorganized. Communication is almost non-existent, and any attempts to seek clarification or support are met with indifference or outright hostility. Promises made during the hiring process about work hours, duties, and compensation were frequently broken, leaving me and other staff members frustrated and demoralized.

The most glaring issue is the abysmal level of client support. Guests often faced significant delays when trying to reach out for assistance, with many inquiries going unanswered for hours or even days. There was no clear system in place for handling guest concerns, and the management’s lack of responsiveness frequently left guests feeling ignored and frustrated.

During my time here, I witnessed numerous instances where guests had legitimate complaints about their accommodations – from cleanliness issues to malfunctioning amenities – that were either inadequately addressed or completely overlooked. The management showed a distinct lack of urgency in resolving these issues, often passing the responsibility onto already overburdened staff without providing the necessary resources or support to fix the problems efficiently.

In summary, the lack of adequate client support and the unprofessional management at this Airbnb property make it a place I cannot recommend. Guests deserve better responsiveness and care, and employees deserve a supportive environment that enables them to provide the best service possible. Unfortunately, this property falls short on both counts. Consider looking elsewhere for a more reliable and pleasant stay.",neg

Potential to work on really cool projectsCulture Culture Culture

They take themselves way too seriously and there is no margin for error. The environment is toxic, oftentimes speaking to people in disrespectful and rude tones. I was literally screamed at and spoken down to as if I was nothing. 

It's very much decision by committee, but the most popular person - not the best idea - wins. I cannot tell you how many times I would advocate for something, have my idea turned down only for leaders to present it as their own idea just a few months later. 

Work/Life balance doesn't exist. Because everyone is remote, they expect you to be available at any and all hours. My boss literally emailed me on Christmas and New Years Eve. It.Never.Stopped. And they would share a firehose of documentation, rarely with context, and by the time you had a chance to review any of it they would have already moved onto the next thing with a whole new set of disorganized documentation - then in the same breath talk about needing to streamline all the documentation. It was like a fire drill orchestrated by an executive with ADHD every single day. Truly maddening. 

They work incredibly fast paced - which can be a great thing - except they don't ever have moments of thoughtful reflection and/or planning to ensure that the work they're so diligently focused on getting out the door is 1) done well or 2) the right thing to be spending resources on in the first place. They pivot so often, you spend most of your time planning, no time deploying, only to have the plans thrown out. 

For being a digitally native company, it's really sad how little they actually understand about digital best practices and getting data on anything is like pulling teeth.",neg

Company provides good salary as compared to market rate along with meals and a travel coupon every 6 months(twice a year). 

During any occasion they outsource catering and the food is really tasty so do not miss any occasion if you are a foodie.

The shift timings were appropriate although rotational but manageable.

If you are lucky enough and get hired on their direct payroll you may get work from home.HR department is the worst department as compared to any company in this industry. They will find different ways to deduct salaries at times. 
Happy hours are a way to ruin the day of those who are non drinkers and non smokers or who are pure vegetarians. 
Their should a different section for the ones who eat veg and for the ones who eat non veg but there wasn't any. 
Politics is an important aspect. The ones who are actually performing and gave constantly great performance were not given ideal positions to climb the leadership ladder. They would give positions to husband's and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends even when they are not performing because they were behaving good in parties and socially accepted by the ones who like buttering.

Equality is only in papers. 

Beware of HR and do not try to get involved in anybody's matters even if your intention is good and you wish to help and they say it won't affect you. 

The cab facility is for one side only.

There is no one to help you if you get unwell in the company as there is no doctor and no medical facility available. There is a rest room though but you will find nobody to help.",neg

 quality standards from their photographer.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
No support from Airbnb and their photography department.  There is no contact at Airbnb for questions and support from anyone at the photography department.  It takes 5 days for them to return an email. They seem to make a point of distancing themselves from both the photographer and host.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Hard to tell.  To have a culture there has to be interaction, and the Photography Department seems to make it an operating rule to not interact with its photographers.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Drive at least an hour to a property and make beautiful pictures for an hour and half.",neg

372,1f6hafjjihijc800,Great sweet beginnings gone sour ,"I’m a couch-surfer at heart, so when I found out about Airbedandbreakfast, I was not entirely sold. Recently graduated and jobless, I decided to give the company a chance in 2011 and...I loved it! Everybody I met (for the most part) was sweet and genuine and believed in “The Mission”. However, as time went by, I felt myself fighting the plight to become a cog in the industrious and social-media driven machine—Efforts to improve workflows were overlooked, chaos seemed to reign in almost every project that was set forth, and Team Leads and Coordinators failed to address relevant points without complicating an issue further.

Of course, to add more salt to the wound, nevermind that you will also get to see that primal greedy side of people at all times (both company-wise and clients): Yeah, a client might be in the wrong here and there, but in truth, the website/app can be convoluted and depending on who tends to your case: Good Luck with getting a refund! As for my ex-teammates: Good luck with moving forward and/or repeating yourself relentlessly and/or disengaging or even apologizing for technological misgivings or misunderstandings which are out of your control. 

My greatest disappointment was being a part of the first Covid-19 related workflow overhaul. My Team and I were not clear on what to do most of the time (regardless of Leads stepping in and playing make-believe support). It was a poor attempt at dealing with a crisis, and sadly, it showed.  

After absolutely no heads-up at any given moment during the pandemic, my Team and many others disintegrated into Nothingness on May 5, 2020,

Yeah—Remote work *can* be great, but if you must constantly choose between your sanity and the job...is it really worth it? ",neg
