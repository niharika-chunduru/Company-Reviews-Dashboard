15,90076902,Frontend roles don't have much growth,"Booking has an excellent international work culture. You get to work from folks from around the world, and that is itself a learning experience. The work-life balance is excellent and their recent policy change for 22-weeks paternal leave is super awesome. Sprint plannings ensure that you're not overloaded, and you can always find time for family and your personal life.
Teams work in small sizes so you get to interact with all the stakeholders so that's a very positive side.
When you join, their relocation team ensures that your experience is seamless. They put the stress out of concern when you think you're moving to a new country.

And don't forget the compensation: it's best in the market! I mean, I've interviewed with FAANG companies and only a very few of them have been able to match my compensation.Moving up the ladder within company, unless you're a fullstack dev, is difficult. There's barely any innovation, or scope for it, unless you work for a core team that develops one of the inhouse frameworks. After a while, the boredom gets you. With each passing year, you understand how detrimental all of it is for your career.
You can learn new tech, but on your own, because most of the times, it won't align with team requirements. Again, unless something falls within the policy, it ain't gonna happen. Policy runs everything here, from people to process.",neg

Some of the quality checks on my specific language was unfair as on many occasions the person who did our evaluations could not even speak our language and deducted points for certain grammar specifications that would not make sense in english or via Google translator, which then obviously affected our perfomance and neither our team leads could do anything against this nonsense. Of course most of the time the best performing folks were on the FR, EN, ES, IT line as you had more time on e-mails where you could close a case in seconds not like on the phone where on multiple occasions a day you received an extremely confusing case that required more time, focus and support than just a few minute call but then on the other hand it was not viewed as a great work opposed to the colleagues who kept closing items by sending a very generic e-mail template and then close the case again which obviously not solve the issue just move it further to another unfortunate colleagues in the future.

They do have very good information at hand via employee handbook and have a good system to easy acess it.I believe the KPI's are not realistic. Booking wanted the calls to be short - under 6 minutes which is basically impossible if you are dealing with complaint or relocation. Short calls would make unhappy customers. Everyone was cheating to reach to KPIs. Personally I do believe that Booking.com are implementing new ideas and projects so fast that the information doesnt fully reach the CS agents and the accessable information is limited which makes it hard to actually reply anything.

The people and culture that was built over the course of the first 10 years!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The company did a great job of making it's employees comfortable. They focused on work/life balance and consistency acted on employees feedback. They provided training for handling stress and many other valuable resources whether it be work or life related.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It was a diverse and inclusive environment where upper management focused on employee engagement and health. It sounds cliche but it really was like a family. Everyone was encouraged to share their thoughts good or indifferent and if an issue came up, the company did it's best to rectify it! 
However all that changed significantly when new leadership took over at the highest levels. You could feel a sizmic shift. Then COVID hit and mobile workplace was implemented. Leadership would speak to the employees via zoom and right away you could feel the disingenuous rhetoric about employees were at the forefront when in fact greed was the motivation!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
We would come into work and listen to the CEO talk about how concerned he was for the employees and that the company was losing revenue. Which was true to an extent except for the fact they were receiving millions in support from the Dutch government and other agencies. Then the kicker was the CEO awarded himself a 7 million dollar bonus. This was proceeded by closing all North American offices and promises of jobs with a third party partner which never materialized! While we were still there the CEO gave the most cringe, phony, and almost comical speeches about how it was for the betterment of the business and they just couldn't afford to keep these offices functioning. Meanwhile the company was recovering and reporting massive quarterly earnings, building a billion dollar new HQ office in Amsterdam. I truly believe the new regime will eventually run what was once a global powerhouse who cared about it's customers, community, and employees into the ground.

The rules and regulations of the company isn't very clear and what is being taken serious and what is taken less serious. Salaries are not revealed until you receive the contract for any position. Doesn't matter if you are applying from an external source or internal. The wages are not good enough for what you do. In my case (customer service). And it really teaches you the fact you can't trust anyone. Opportunities and projects are always keeps quiet and confidential and only a few select people can be involved and to progress. No clear promotion program available. Your hard work and effort isn't being recognized and your not being treated fairly. At the end of the year you get a bonus based on your work but they do not tell you how your end score is being judged. It's all a maze game and just plays with your mind.

They promise too much and deliver almost nothing. They don’t give ANY credit to whom deserves it. 
Promotions only if you get personal friend with management.

346,1g3pc5fslicbp802,A company for young people,I worked for 2 departments in this company and concluded that this company is not for parents who have small children. Some managers believe small children can be left in a room alone and you will be blamed if you prioritise your family. Overall this company is good for young people who have no family to take care of. Of course it depends on the departments so I would recommend to check it when you have an interview.,neg

358,1fvsl3tubt4jb800,Great work culture and environment . Tough calls. ,It was a call centre so having a work life balance is nearly impossible with any company. The training was okay but definitely better than more. They at least invested in a training version of their CSM so you can practice. They have a phone in help desk for assistance during a call and they have a tech support department if your having issues with your computer. HR is available and accessible. Benefits are good and requesting time off is not difficult but obviously still needs to go through an approval process. The queue itself was very fast paced and the calls can be stressful. ,neg

360,1fueq5gnnt5js801,Gvvv,"Pros

Great people to work with and learn from, you get much more responsibility at Booking.com compared to other large companies I have worked for, and this sense of autonomy really makes you feel like you are owning your work and improving your skills in a company that actually cares about your career. Relocation team went above and beyond to really make you feel valued, before you have even started! Culture is friendly and there are always open conversations going on throughout the business on important topics, such as wellbeing, diversity and inclusion. Work/life balance is great and lots of perks!

Cons

Onboarding remotely wasn't the most fun in a pandemic but Booking.com did their best to keep us all engaged throughout the sessions",pos

Negatives:

364,1ft9fbj0mu1ec800,Read current news,"Crazy hours- liked the 4 10s but not swing shifting from second to third shift.

Complaints- so many complaints all night long in customer service. You get rated even if the guest had a horrible experience at a hotel. Money doesn't fix things with guests but that's how they handle it.

Amsterdam Trip- got cancelled for most at random and very pre Covid. It was supposed to be a benefit.

No real bonus- would have been nice to have less swag and a more livable wage.

Casual Dress Code, Everyone has the same personality, company parties and swag was fun. Massage chairs and free fruit.

They just laid thousands off world wide. Google is your friend.",neg
