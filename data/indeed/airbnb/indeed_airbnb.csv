Great sweet beginnings gone sour ,"I’m a couch-surfer at heart, so when I found out about Airbedandbreakfast, I was not entirely sold. Recently graduated and jobless, I decided to give the company a chance in 2011 and...I loved it! Everybody I met (for the most part) was sweet and genuine and believed in “The Mission”. However, as time went by, I felt myself fighting the plight to become a cog in the industrious and social-media driven machine—Efforts to improve workflows were overlooked, chaos seemed to reign in almost every project that was set forth, and Team Leads and Coordinators failed to address relevant points without complicating an issue further.

Of course, to add more salt to the wound, nevermind that you will also get to see that primal greedy side of people at all times (both company-wise and clients): Yeah, a client might be in the wrong here and there, but in truth, the website/app can be convoluted and depending on who tends to your case: Good Luck with getting a refund! As for my ex-teammates: Good luck with moving forward and/or repeating yourself relentlessly and/or disengaging or even apologizing for technological misgivings or misunderstandings which are out of your control. 

My greatest disappointment was being a part of the first Covid-19 related workflow overhaul. My Team and I were not clear on what to do most of the time (regardless of Leads stepping in and playing make-believe support). It was a poor attempt at dealing with a crisis, and sadly, it showed.  

After absolutely no heads-up at any given moment during the pandemic, my Team and many others disintegrated into Nothingness on May 5, 2020,

Yeah—Remote work *can* be great, but if you must constantly choose between your sanity and the job...is it really worth it?
