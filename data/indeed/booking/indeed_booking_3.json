{"reviews":[{"title":"Started as an exciting journey and ended as a disappointing failure with so much unfilled potential!","text":"What is the best part of working at the company?\nThe people and culture that was built over the course of the first 10 years!\n\nWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?\nThe company did a great job of making it's employees comfortable. They focused on work/life balance and consistency acted on employees feedback. They provided training for handling stress and many other valuable resources whether it be work or life related.\n\nWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?\nIt was a diverse and inclusive environment where upper management focused on employee engagement and health. It sounds cliche but it really was like a family. Everyone was encouraged to share their thoughts good or indifferent and if an issue came up, the company did it's best to rectify it! \nHowever all that changed significantly when new leadership took over at the highest levels. You could feel a sizmic shift. Then COVID hit and mobile workplace was implemented. Leadership would speak to the employees via zoom and right away you could feel the disingenuous rhetoric about employees were at the forefront when in fact greed was the motivation!\n\nWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?\nWe would come into work and listen to the CEO talk about how concerned he was for the employees and that the company was losing revenue. Which was true to an extent except for the fact they were receiving millions in support from the Dutch government and other agencies. Then the kicker was the CEO awarded himself a 7 million dollar bonus. This was proceeded by closing all North American offices and promises of jobs with a third party partner which never materialized! While we were still there the CEO gave the most cringe, phony, and almost comical speeches about how it was for the betterment of the business and they just couldn't afford to keep these offices functioning. Meanwhile the company was recovering and reporting massive quarterly earnings, building a billion dollar new HQ office in Amsterdam. I truly believe the new regime will eventually run what was once a global powerhouse who cared about it's customers, community, and employees into the ground. I don't wish this to happen but when greed and self loathing are the driving characteristics of the leader, unfortunately the inevitable is sure to surface.","rating":"3","id":"1h6t61rtbkuje800","language":"en","reviewer":"Team Leader","location":"Grand Rapids, MI","cons":"","pros":"","url":"https://indeed.com/cmp/Booking.com/reviews/started-as-an-exciting-journey-and-ended-as-a-disappointing-failure-with-so-much-unfilled-potential?id=6a8a0487e2cc45ac","datetime":"2023-08-03T00:00:00","reviewer_employee_type":"Former Employee","job_work_and_life_balance_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","job_security_and_advancement_rating":"0","management_rating":"0","job_culture_rating":"0"},{"title":"Nooit gaan werken","text":"Je bent een wegwerp product voor hun.

It gives headaches and mentally effects you, the option to work from home is available but not very suitable for everyone. Managers are not there to help you but rather to put you on the spot as soon as you slip up on anything. The managers and coulluges have favorites. The rules and regulations of the company isn't very clear and what is being taken serious and what is taken less serious. Salaries are not revealed until you receive the contract for any position. Doesn't matter if you are applying from an external source or internal. The wages are not good enough for what you do. In my case (customer service). And it really teaches you the fact you can't trust anyone. Opportunities and projects are always keeps quiet and confidential and only a few select people can be involved and to progress. No clear promotion program available. Your hard work and effort isn't being recognized and your not being treated fairly. At the end of the year you get a bonus based on your work but they do not tell you how your end score is being judged. It's all a maze game and just plays with your mind. Also people with less skills and knowledge are more likely to get a higher position than you because it's not based on skill but rather personality and ars* lic*ing.","rating":"1","id":"1h6cpk3n62946001","language":"en","reviewer":"Customer Service","location":"Manchester City Centre","cons":"No flexibility or equality, pay is bad, micromanagement, toxic environment, poor management and development opportunities.","pros":"Free lunches, breakfast, coffee's, teas and fruits.
