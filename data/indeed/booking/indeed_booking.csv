Great internship,"My internship at Booking.com was a rewarding experience. The Accounts Receivable team was supportive and fostered an environment of learning. I was given real responsibilities which allowed me to understand the intricacies of financial operations in a global company. The exposure to various accounting software and systems enhanced my technical skills. The company culture was inclusive and encouraged collaboration, making it easy for me to integrate and contribute. Regular feedback sessions with my supervisor helped me improve my work efficiency. The opportunity to work with diverse teams provided me with a broader perspective of the business. Despite the challenging tasks, the work-life balance was commendable.

Don't pay market rate,"As a former customer service associate at Booking.com, I can say that the company has its pros and cons. On the one hand, the company has a great culture and a friendly work environment. However, I did notice that people who got promoted tended to be those who were friendly with the leadership team, rather than those who were the most qualified for the job.

Additionally, while the job itself was not particularly difficult, the amount of work expected from us was quite high, especially given the low pay. I often felt overworked and underpaid, which led to a lot of stress and burnout. Overall, I would recommend Booking.com as a good place to work, but only if you are willing to accept the low pay and put up with the high workload.",4,1hbgsgth62dul000,en,Customer Service Associate,"Orlando, FL",,,https://indeed.com/cmp/Booking.com/reviews/don-t-pay-market-rate?id=ec371579b001f375,2023-09-29T00:00:00,Former Employee,0,0,0,0,0

Started as an exciting journey and ended as a disappointing failure with so much unfilled potential!,"What is the best part of working at the company?
The people and culture that was built over the course of the first 10 years!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The company did a great job of making it's employees comfortable. They focused on work/life balance and consistency acted on employees feedback. They provided training for handling stress and many other valuable resources whether it be work or life related.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It was a diverse and inclusive environment where upper management focused on employee engagement and health. It sounds cliche but it really was like a family. Everyone was encouraged to share their thoughts good or indifferent and if an issue came up, the company did it's best to rectify it! 
However all that changed significantly when new leadership took over at the highest levels. You could feel a sizmic shift. Then COVID hit and mobile workplace was implemented. Leadership would speak to the employees via zoom and right away you could feel the disingenuous rhetoric about employees were at the forefront when in fact greed was the motivation!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
We would come into work and listen to the CEO talk about how concerned he was for the employees and that the company was losing revenue. Which was true to an extent except for the fact they were receiving millions in support from the Dutch government and other agencies. Then the kicker was the CEO awarded himself a 7 million dollar bonus. This was proceeded by closing all North American offices and promises of jobs with a third party partner which never materialized! While we were still there the CEO gave the most cringe, phony, and almost comical speeches about how it was for the betterment of the business and they just couldn't afford to keep these offices functioning. Meanwhile the company was recovering and reporting massive quarterly earnings, building a billion dollar new HQ office in Amsterdam. I truly believe the new regime will eventually run what was once a global powerhouse who cared about it's customers, community, and employees into the ground. I don't wish this to happen but when greed and self loathing are the driving characteristics of the leader, unfortunately the inevitable is sure to surface.",3,1h6t61rtbkuje800,en,Team Leader,"Grand Rapids, MI",,,https://indeed.com/cmp/Booking.com/reviews/started-as-an-exciting-journey-and-ended-as-a-disappointing-failure-with-so-much-unfilled-potential?id=6a8a0487e2cc45ac,2023-08-03T00:00:00,Former Employee,0,0,0,0,0

"Bad,toxic and spying ","The working environment at the office is very poor due to so much toxicity and always loud. It gives headaches and mentally effects you, the option to work from home is available but not very suitable for everyone. Managers are not there to help you but rather to put you on the spot as soon as you slip up on anything. The managers and coulluges have favorites. The rules and regulations of the company isn't very clear and what is being taken serious and what is taken less serious. Salaries are not revealed until you receive the contract for any position. Doesn't matter if you are applying from an external source or internal. The wages are not good enough for what you do. In my case (customer service). And it really teaches you the fact you can't trust anyone. Opportunities and projects are always keeps quiet and confidential and only a few select people can be involved and to progress. No clear promotion program available. Your hard work and effort isn't being recognized and your not being treated fairly. At the end of the year you get a bonus based on your work but they do not tell you how your end score is being judged. It's all a maze game and just plays with your mind.

"Poor training, worse management and no support","Was mislead into thinking the job had anything to do with hotel or travel, when in fact I was interviewing for a car rental service under booking, information I did not receive until my final interview. Training was okay.  
A typical day at work includes IT issues that will not be solved for months, taking phone calls from incredibly angry customers, and receiving no help from anyone. My line manager left for holiday the second I completed training and started the job and so I was left to fend for myself with little to no support. Calling others for help is met with snarky comments about ""you should have learnt this during training"" which I probably would have had it not been for the fact that the last week of training was so plagued by IT issues I got no practical on the job training whatsoever.

Great work culture and environment . Tough calls. ,It was a call centre so having a work life balance is nearly impossible with any company. The training was okay but definitely better than more.

Benefits are good and requesting time off is not difficult but obviously still needs to go through an approval process.

Gvvv,"Pros

Great people to work with and learn from, you get much more responsibility at Booking.com compared to other large companies I have worked for, and this sense of autonomy really makes you feel like you are owning your work and improving your skills in a company that actually cares about your career. Relocation team went above and beyond to really make you feel valued, before you have even started! Culture is friendly and there are always open conversations going on throughout the business on important topics, such as wellbeing, diversity and inclusion. Work/life balance is great and lots of perks!
