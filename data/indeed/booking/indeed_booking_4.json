They care for you as an employee , as any company they love money however  hey admit when they make mistake and aren't afraid to admit it and make things better, something i wish most companies would do. Booking is an European company for the most and i think is thanks to that that the benefits, management and work culture are so much more advance than companies in the USA. If you ever get the chance to work for them you are extremely lucky!. If you prepare well for an interview you can get anywhere there, I personally never saw favoritism, I genuinely did my best in the interviews and got the job. It is important o know that the interview is key here and they are not super easy, you do need to prepare yourself well.
