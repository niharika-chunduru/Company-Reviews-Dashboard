Great internship,"My internship at Booking.com was a rewarding experience. The Accounts Receivable team was supportive and fostered an environment of learning. I was given real responsibilities which allowed me to understand the intricacies of financial operations in a global company. The exposure to various accounting software and systems enhanced my technical skills. The company culture was inclusive and encouraged collaboration, making it easy for me to integrate and contribute. Regular feedback sessions with my supervisor helped me improve my work efficiency. The opportunity to work with diverse teams provided me with a broader perspective of the business. Despite the challenging tasks, the work-life balance was commendable.

Don't pay market rate,"As a former customer service associate at Booking.com, I can say that the company has its pros and cons. On the one hand, the company has a great culture and a friendly work environment. However, I did notice that people who got promoted tended to be those who were friendly with the leadership team, rather than those who were the most qualified for the job.

Additionally, while the job itself was not particularly difficult, the amount of work expected from us was quite high, especially given the low pay. I often felt overworked and underpaid, which led to a lot of stress and burnout. Overall, I would recommend Booking.com as a good place to work, but only if you are willing to accept the low pay and put up with the high workload.",4,1hbgsgth62dul000,en,Customer Service Associate,"Orlando, FL",,,https://indeed.com/cmp/Booking.com/reviews/don-t-pay-market-rate?id=ec371579b001f375,2023-09-29T00:00:00,Former Employee,0,0,0,0,0

Started as an exciting journey and ended as a disappointing failure with so much unfilled potential!,"What is the best part of working at the company?
The people and culture that was built over the course of the first 10 years!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The company did a great job of making it's employees comfortable. They focused on work/life balance and consistency acted on employees feedback. They provided training for handling stress and many other valuable resources whether it be work or life related.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It was a diverse and inclusive environment where upper management focused on employee engagement and health. It sounds cliche but it really was like a family. Everyone was encouraged to share their thoughts good or indifferent and if an issue came up, the company did it's best to rectify it! 
However all that changed significantly when new leadership took over at the highest levels. You could feel a sizmic shift. Then COVID hit and mobile workplace was implemented. Leadership would speak to the employees via zoom and right away you could feel the disingenuous rhetoric about employees were at the forefront when in fact greed was the motivation!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
We would come into work and listen to the CEO talk about how concerned he was for the employees and that the company was losing revenue. Which was true to an extent except for the fact they were receiving millions in support from the Dutch government and other agencies. Then the kicker was the CEO awarded himself a 7 million dollar bonus. This was proceeded by closing all North American offices and promises of jobs with a third party partner which never materialized! While we were still there the CEO gave the most cringe, phony, and almost comical speeches about how it was for the betterment of the business and they just couldn't afford to keep these offices functioning. Meanwhile the company was recovering and reporting massive quarterly earnings, building a billion dollar new HQ office in Amsterdam. I truly believe the new regime will eventually run what was once a global powerhouse who cared about it's customers, community, and employees into the ground. I don't wish this to happen but when greed and self loathing are the driving characteristics of the leader, unfortunately the inevitable is sure to surface.",3,1h6t61rtbkuje800,en,Team Leader,"Grand Rapids, MI",,,https://indeed.com/cmp/Booking.com/reviews/started-as-an-exciting-journey-and-ended-as-a-disappointing-failure-with-so-much-unfilled-potential?id=6a8a0487e2cc45ac,2023-08-03T00:00:00,Former Employee,0,0,0,0,0

"Bad,toxic and spying ","The working environment at the office is very poor due to so much toxicity and always loud. It gives headaches and mentally effects you, the option to work from home is available but not very suitable for everyone. Managers are not there to help you but rather to put you on the spot as soon as you slip up on anything. The managers and coulluges have favorites. The rules and regulations of the company isn't very clear and what is being taken serious and what is taken less serious. Salaries are not revealed until you receive the contract for any position. Doesn't matter if you are applying from an external source or internal. The wages are not good enough for what you do. In my case (customer service). And it really teaches you the fact you can't trust anyone. Opportunities and projects are always keeps quiet and confidential and only a few select people can be involved and to progress. No clear promotion program available. Your hard work and effort isn't being recognized and your not being treated fairly. At the end of the year you get a bonus based on your work but they do not tell you how your end score is being judged. It's all a maze game and just plays with your mind.

This is the best company I've ever worked for.,"Booking.com is already in the future, compensation package overall is one of the best out there, amount of PTO, job and life balance. Career advancement and opportunities are top. I worked there for 6 years, went from a call center agent to work in two other departments. They care for you as an employee , as any company they love money however  hey admit when they make mistake and aren't afraid to admit it and make things better, something i wish most companies would do. Booking is an European company for the most and i think is thanks to that that the benefits, management and work culture are so much more advance than companies in the USA. If you ever get the chance to work for them you are extremely lucky!. If you prepare well for an interview you can get anywhere there, I personally never saw favoritism, I genuinely did my best in the interviews and got the job. It is important o know that the interview is key here and they are not super easy, you do need to prepare yourself well.

You are a number not a person,"If you are trying to get in the company to thrive and develop yourself, will not happen. They are trying their best to keep everyone in the same department with no option for promotion. If you are 2 min late, you need to report to your manager and then write a whole report on how you will improve yourself. It is a tempo and you are always being watched and evaluated. They are digging for your mistakes, quality control is listening to your calls and evaluating your tone of voice and empathy. With them having none. Basically it is a corporate prison. Not a healthy company to work at, at least if you don’t want to end up with a burnout. It was the most awful experience to work there. Except lunch, nothing is good there. Don’t say no one told you.
