You work like a dog, ok like a robot, and there's so many rules and changes. Also not much flexibility like other jobs, everything is timed and you need to be accurate all the time. The more you do, the morr you realise the salary should be atleast 30k or abouts. For the same salary you can do an easier job else where. Also the management is ok, however you do feel like they look down on you and speak to you like you are another number and that shouldn't be like that.
