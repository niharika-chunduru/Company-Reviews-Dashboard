It's ok,"It's OK working here but the salary is way too low for the amount of work you have to do. You work like a dog, ok like a robot, and there's so many rules and changes.

For the same salary you can do an easier job else where. Also the management is ok, however you do feel like they look down on you and speak to you like you are another number and that shouldn't be like that.
