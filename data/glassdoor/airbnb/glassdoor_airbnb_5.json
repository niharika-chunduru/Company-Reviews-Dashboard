They interview potential employees not just for relevant job skill and experience, but you also go through core values interviews. They care deeply about what kind of person you are and how you fit culturally. \n\nThey paid 100% of my health insurance, matched 401k, gave significant quarterly credits for Airbnb rentals (I never paid for a stay when traveling abroad while I worked there), and provided exceptional free lunches every day.","cons":"I’m only upset that I was laid off during the pandemic. I care deeply for this company and my team and I desperately wanted us to make it through the hard times together.","advice":"Don’t lose sight of what made people love you. Continue to care, provide, motivate, grow, and adhere to the core values that made me and many others like me feel happy and fulfilled in the workplace and as customers.","reviewer":"Technical Producer","datetime":"2024-06-15T01:57:01.720","language":"en","id":"88277353","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"5","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"POSITIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW88263809.htm","rating":"4","title":"A truly great place to work","pros":"Good benefits, permanent wfh, great culture","cons":"Low progression, limited scope of promotions","advice":null,"reviewer":"SFA Senior Financial Analyst","datetime":"2024-06-14T11:07:16.257","language":"en","id":"88263809","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"POSITIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW88211671.htm","rating":"4","title":"Good place to work.
