Communication is almost non-existent, and any attempts to seek clarification or support are met with indifference or outright hostility. Promises made during the hiring process about work hours, duties, and compensation were frequently broken, leaving me and other staff members frustrated and demoralized.\n\nThe most glaring issue is the abysmal level of client support. Guests often faced significant delays when trying to reach out for assistance, with many inquiries going unanswered for hours or even days. There was no clear system in place for handling guest concerns, and the management’s lack of responsiveness frequently left guests feeling ignored and frustrated.\n\nDuring my time here, I witnessed numerous instances where guests had legitimate complaints about their accommodations – from cleanliness issues to malfunctioning amenities – that were either inadequately addressed or completely overlooked. The management showed a distinct lack of urgency in resolving these issues, often passing the responsibility onto already overburdened staff without providing the necessary resources or support to fix the problems efficiently.\n\nIn summary, the lack of adequate client support and the unprofessional management at this Airbnb property make it a place I cannot recommend. Guests deserve better responsiveness and care, and employees deserve a supportive environment that enables them to provide the best service possible. Unfortunately, this property falls short on both counts. Consider looking elsewhere for a more reliable and pleasant stay.","advice":null,"reviewer":"Project Manager","datetime":"2024-07-22T14:53:01.727","language":"en","id":"89382911","culture_and_values_rating":"1","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"1","work_life_balance_rating":"1","senior_management_rating":"1","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"1","career_opportunities_rating":"1","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"DISAPPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"NEGATIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"NEGATIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89382288.htm","rating":"5","title":"its great","pros":"great work life balance now","cons":"not too much to worry about","advice":null,"reviewer":"Senior Software Engineer","datetime":"2024-07-22T14:27:02.717","language":"en","id":"89382288","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89317447.htm","rating":"1","title":"Work somewhere else","pros":"There are no pros about this job.","cons":"The money I earn is not enough to provide basic necessities for me and my family.","advice":null,"reviewer":"Housekeeper","datetime":"2024-07-19T18:36:00.533","language":"en","id":"89317447","culture_and_values_rating":"1","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"1","work_life_balance_rating":"1","senior_management_rating":"1","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"1","career_opportunities_rating":"1","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"DISAPPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"NEGATIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"NEGATIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89276352.htm","rating":"3","title":"Review","pros":"Remote work and you have opportunities to grow","cons":"Not a good salary and the managers are not cool in some departments","advice":null,"reviewer":"Claims Specialist","datetime":"2024-07-18T10:44:46.323","language":"en","id":"89276352","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89243209.htm","rating":"3","title":"Promote based on seniority as well","pros":"Work/life balance\nAmazing management\nTeam environment was amazing","cons":"Strange hours with no room for improvement\nFriday was my Monday\nPromotions were based on favorites","advice":"Promote people who deserve to be promoted.
