{"reviews":[{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW84171572.htm","rating":"5","title":"Great company, great culture, great benefits, limited upward mobility","pros":"I worked with the most amazing, talented, empathetic teammates in the company as Airbnb emphasizes core values greatly in the recruitment process. Even though it is a big company, I had a chance at working on different projects that made my tenure really interesting and provided me with ample challenges to grow and learn. There's opportunities to travel for work too and lots of social activities for the employees. People generally are for each other.\n\nThe benefits are amazing, and you can work remotes 100% of the time. You can also choose to work in an office.","cons":"Upward and cross-functional mobility is really difficult as much of those opportunities are in Europe and North America. There's not much in APAC. They prefer to hire externally, which is unfortunate for those who have been loyal to the company for a long time.","advice":"Please prioritise internal mobility for your current employees and believe that they can perform in other roles. Or rather give them a chance at it.","reviewer":"Market Manager","datetime":"2024-02-07T18:36:17.390","language":"en","id":"84171572","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"5","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"3","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"POSITIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW84041613.htm","rating":"5","title":"Great","pros":"Great office.
