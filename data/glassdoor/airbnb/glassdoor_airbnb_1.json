The company culture is goodâ€”Airbnb values diversity, inclusivity, and employee well-being. The team spirit and camaraderie among colleagues made it a good place to work, and there were always opportunities to learn and grow within the company.","cons":"There are a few areas where Airbnb could improve. While the work environment was positive, the salary wasn't as competitive as I would have hoped, especially considering the demands of the job. Additionally, the majority of shifts were during the night, which could be challenging for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.","advice":null,"reviewer":"IT Support Specialist","datetime":"2024-08-08T03:48:44.417","language":"en","id":"89901103","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89849560.htm","rating":"4","title":"Decent job","pros":"- Good WLB\n- Great compensation","cons":"- Decision made from the top down\n- Limited opportunities for career growth","advice":null,"reviewer":null,"datetime":"2024-08-06T17:29:46.980","language":"en","id":"89849560","culture_and_values_rating":"4","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"NO_OPINION","rating_business_outlook":"NEUTRAL","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89827018.htm","rating":"3","title":"The environment was nice","pros":"Having a great team with multiple nationalities","cons":"The salary was low for the work","advice":null,"reviewer":"Customer Support Representative","datetime":"2024-08-06T04:43:36.630","language":"en","id":"89827018","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW89818052.htm","rating":"3","title":"Great place to be","pros":"Awesome team, great people, niche tech","cons":"Politics as usual.
