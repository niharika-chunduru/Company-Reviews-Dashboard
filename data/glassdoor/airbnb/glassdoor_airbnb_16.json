They will find different ways to deduct salaries at times. \nHappy hours are a way to ruin the day of those who are non drinkers and non smokers or who are pure vegetarians. \nTheir should a different section for the ones who eat veg and for the ones who eat non veg but there wasn't any. \nPolitics is an important aspect. The ones who are actually performing and gave constantly great performance were not given ideal positions to climb the leadership ladder. They would give positions to husband's and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends even when they are not performing because they were behaving good in parties and socially accepted by the ones who like buttering.\n\nEquality is only in papers. \n\nBeware of HR and do not try to get involved in anybody's matters even if your intention is good and you wish to help and they say it won't affect you. \n\nThe cab facility is for one side only.\n\nThere is no one to help you if you get unwell in the company as there is no doctor and no medical facility available. There is a rest room though but you will find nobody to help.","advice":null,"reviewer":"Customer Experience Specialist","datetime":"2023-12-27T04:42:54.687","language":"en","id":"82865247","culture_and_values_rating":"3","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"NEGATIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW82811804.htm","rating":"4","title":"Great Company","pros":"Flexible\nGreat Work Culture\nSalary","cons":"Need to Arrange some outing","advice":null,"reviewer":"Devops Engineer","datetime":"2023-12-22T23:48:36.383","language":"en","id":"82811804","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW82703003.htm","rating":"3","title":"Not recommended for the people who want to really develop themselves","pros":"Good benefits , flexible location and working hours","cons":"Don't like the company environment that the people don't concentrate on the real business but gossiping and political things.","advice":null,"reviewer":null,"datetime":"2023-12-18T20:46:10.720","language":"en","id":"82703003","culture_and_values_rating":"2","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"3","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"2","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"NEGATIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW82607451.htm","rating":"5","title":"Good environnement ","pros":"Good environment, multicultural, respectful people","cons":"Low payment and kpis need to be revised","advice":null,"reviewer":"Travel Advisor","datetime":"2023-12-14T13:05:27.823","language":"en","id":"82607451","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"4","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"3","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"NO_OPINION","rating_business_outlook":"NEUTRAL","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW82585672.htm","rating":"5","title":"Great place to work","pros":"remote work option\ngood salary","cons":"sometimes can be high pressure\ntop down","advice":null,"reviewer":"Software Engineer","datetime":"2023-12-13T21:55:30.353","language":"en","id":"82585672","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null}],"totals":{"review_count":2761,"filtered_reviews_count":2050,"average_rating":"4.2","overall_rating":"4.2","culture_and_values_rating":"4.2","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4.3","work_life_balance_rating":"4.1","senior_management_rating":"3.7","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4.1","career_opportunities_rating":"3.6","ceo_rating":"91%","business_outlook_rating":"76%","recommend_to_friend_rating":"81%"},"details":{"logo":null,"title":null}}
