Communication is almost non-existent, and any attempts to seek clarification or support are met with indifference or outright hostility. Promises made during the hiring process about work hours, duties, and compensation were frequently broken, leaving me and other staff members frustrated and demoralized.

The most glaring issue is the abysmal level of client support. Guests often faced significant delays when trying to reach out for assistance, with many inquiries going unanswered for hours or even days. There was no clear system in place for handling guest concerns, and the management’s lack of responsiveness frequently left guests feeling ignored and frustrated.

During my time here, I witnessed numerous instances where guests had legitimate complaints about their accommodations – from cleanliness issues to malfunctioning amenities – that were either inadequately addressed or completely overlooked. The management showed a distinct lack of urgency in resolving these issues, often passing the responsibility onto already overburdened staff without providing the necessary resources or support to fix the problems efficiently.

In summary, the lack of adequate client support and the unprofessional management at this Airbnb property make it a place I cannot recommend. Guests deserve better responsiveness and care, and employees deserve a supportive environment that enables them to provide the best service possible. Unfortunately, this property falls short on both counts.

Interesting Industry 
Potential to work on really cool projects","Culture Culture Culture

They take themselves way too seriously and there is no margin for error. The environment is toxic, oftentimes speaking to people in disrespectful and rude tones. I was literally screamed at and spoken down to as if I was nothing. 

It's very much decision by committee, but the most popular person - not the best idea - wins. I cannot tell you how many times I would advocate for something, have my idea turned down only for leaders to present it as their own idea just a few months later. 

Work/Life balance doesn't exist. Because everyone is remote, they expect you to be available at any and all hours. My boss literally emailed me on Christmas and New Years Eve. It.Never.Stopped. And they would share a firehose of documentation, rarely with context, and by the time you had a chance to review any of it they would have already moved onto the next thing with a whole new set of disorganized documentation - then in the same breath talk about needing to streamline all the documentation. It was like a fire drill orchestrated by an executive with ADHD every single day. Truly maddening. 

They work incredibly fast paced - which can be a great thing - except they don't ever have moments of thoughtful reflection and/or planning to ensure that the work they're so diligently focused on getting out the door is 1) done well or 2) the right thing to be spending resources on in the first place. They pivot so often, you spend most of your time planning, no time deploying, only to have the plans thrown out. 

For being a digitally native company, it's really sad how little they actually understand about digital best practices and getting data on anything is like pulling teeth.","Slow down. Invest in data foundation so you can actually validate what the priorities of work should be. The CEO should be listening to his people - the people he hired to do a job - rather than making top down decisions arbitrarily based on his 'gut'. This isn't a design firm, it's an ecommerce business. Allow for upward feedback on leadership and actually take it seriously. Create an environment where people feel like they can speak up and they won't risk retaliation.

Flexibility: The flexibility to work remotely has been a game-changer, allowing for a better work-life balance and the ability to tailor my schedule to my needs.
Growth Opportunities: The company provides ample opportunities for professional growth and development through training programs, mentorship, and challenging projects.
Mission-Driven: Being part of a company with a clear mission to create memorable experiences for guests and hosts around the world is incredibly rewarding and motivating.","Remote Onboarding: For new employees, starting remotely can be challenging as it lacks the hands-on experience and immediate support that an in-person onboarding process would provide.

Limited Social Interaction: Building relationships with colleagues can be more challenging when working remotely, which may impact team cohesion and camaraderie.

Communication Challenges: Working from home can sometimes lead to communication barriers, especially for those who thrive on face-to-face interactions.","Facilitate Annual In-person Gatherings: Recognizing the importance of face-to-face interaction, especially for onshore teams, consider organizing annual in-person gatherings where team members can come together to strengthen relationships, foster collaboration, and align on strategic objectives. These gatherings provide invaluable opportunities for team bonding, brainstorming, and professional development, enhancing overall team cohesion and productivity.",Project Manager,2024-03-10T10:58:13.077,en,85181402,5,5,5,5,5,5,,True,APPROVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Any semblance of being rude and condescending is seen as being unprofessional and not a team player.

Working cross functionally will be an exposure to so many projects where you will learn a lot about Airbnb. Always contribute what you know and you will be rewarded!,Sometimes people can be onion skinned so be very wary on how you approach people within the company specially if it is a cross functional interaction. You don't want to rub off a wrong attitude towards others.,Be keen on what every employee is asking for and make sure to focus on what is really important.
