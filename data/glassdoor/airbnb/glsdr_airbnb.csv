Communication is almost non-existent, and any attempts to seek clarification or support are met with indifference or outright hostility. Promises made during the hiring process about work hours, duties, and compensation were frequently broken, leaving me and other staff members frustrated and demoralized.

The most glaring issue is the abysmal level of client support. Guests often faced significant delays when trying to reach out for assistance, with many inquiries going unanswered for hours or even days. There was no clear system in place for handling guest concerns, and the management’s lack of responsiveness frequently left guests feeling ignored and frustrated.

During my time here, I witnessed numerous instances where guests had legitimate complaints about their accommodations – from cleanliness issues to malfunctioning amenities – that were either inadequately addressed or completely overlooked. The management showed a distinct lack of urgency in resolving these issues, often passing the responsibility onto already overburdened staff without providing the necessary resources or support to fix the problems efficiently.

In summary, the lack of adequate client support and the unprofessional management at this Airbnb property make it a place I cannot recommend. Guests deserve better responsiveness and care, and employees deserve a supportive environment that enables them to provide the best service possible. Unfortunately, this property falls short on both counts.
