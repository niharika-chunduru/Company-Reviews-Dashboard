Any semblance of being rude and condescending is seen as being unprofessional and not a team player. You will need to be kind at all times and because you will never know what feedback you will receive from your co-workers. Working cross functionally will be an exposure to so many projects where you will learn a lot about Airbnb. Always contribute what you know and you will be rewarded!","cons":"Sometimes people can be onion skinned so be very wary on how you approach people within the company specially if it is a cross functional interaction. You don't want to rub off a wrong attitude towards others.","advice":"Be keen on what every employee is asking for and make sure to focus on what is really important. We tend to redirect our attention to some burning fire and then forget what really matters - customer experience and employee experience.","reviewer":"Quality Lead","datetime":"2023-12-04T00:41:29.400","language":"en","id":"82293480","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"5","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"5","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"POSITIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW82229772.htm","rating":"5","title":"Great company culture","pros":"A nice company with long-term growth potential.","cons":"Twice-a-year release cycle could be stressful for some teams.","advice":"Need another hit product for the future.","reviewer":"Staff Software Engineer","datetime":"2023-11-30T19:37:04.023","language":"en","id":"82229772","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"5","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"5","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"POSITIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW82199375.htm","rating":"4","title":"Good place, contractors only","pros":"Easy work.
