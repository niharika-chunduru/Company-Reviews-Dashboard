You get to work from folks from around the world, and that is itself a learning experience. The work-life balance is excellent and their recent policy change for 22-weeks paternal leave is super awesome. Sprint plannings ensure that you're not overloaded, and you can always find time for family and your personal life.\nTeams work in small sizes so you get to interact with all the stakeholders so that's a very positive side.\nWhen you join, their relocation team ensures that your experience is seamless. They put the stress out of concern when you think you're moving to a new country.\n\nAnd don't forget the compensation: it's best in the market! I mean, I've interviewed with FAANG companies and only a very few of them have been able to match my compensation.","cons":"Moving up the ladder within company, unless you're a fullstack dev, is difficult. There's barely any innovation, or scope for it, unless you work for a core team that develops one of the inhouse frameworks. After a while, the boredom gets you. With each passing year, you understand how detrimental all of it is for your career.\nYou can learn new tech, but on your own, because most of the times, it won't align with team requirements. Again, unless something falls within the policy, it ain't gonna happen. Policy runs everything here, from people to process.","advice":"Be more flexible. Do the right thing, not just say it. Don't back off just because you're afraid of losing.","reviewer":"Frontend Software Engineer II","datetime":"2024-08-14T03:49:10.960","language":"en","id":"90076902","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"NEGATIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW90072659.htm","rating":"4","title":"Awesome work culture and high tech work tools","pros":"I believed that this company one of the best i worked for , its corporate but still good for development, the HR especially, they really nurtured you","cons":"The disagreement between the top level management","advice":"More transparency","reviewer":"Junior Marketing Associate","datetime":"2024-08-14T00:25:50.120","language":"en","id":"90072659","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"5","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW90069265.htm","rating":"4","title":"Worth it","pros":"Good company culture and team","cons":"Limited growth opportunities for region","advice":null,"reviewer":"Account Executive","datetime":"2024-08-13T21:23:53.743","language":"en","id":"90069265","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW90046735.htm","rating":"5","title":"5","pros":"great team, good benefits, and a location","cons":"The job is repetitive and there's a low chance to advance","advice":null,"reviewer":"Customer Service Representative","datetime":"2024-08-13T08:00:28.783","language":"en","id":"90046735","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW90036361.htm","rating":"4","title":"Project manager","pros":"Good benefits and good pace of workload","cons":"Not exactly what I would want to do","advice":null,"reviewer":"Project Manager","datetime":"2024-08-13T01:48:29.723","language":"en","id":"90036361","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null}],"totals":{"review_count":8209,"filtered_reviews_count":6963,"average_rating":"4.1","overall_rating":"4.1","culture_and_values_rating":"4.2","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4.4","work_life_balance_rating":"4.2","senior_management_rating":"3.6","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4.1","career_opportunities_rating":"3.6","ceo_rating":"80%","business_outlook_rating":"75%","recommend_to_friend_rating":"83%"},"details":{"logo":null,"title":null}}
