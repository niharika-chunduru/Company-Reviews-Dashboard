The work was varied - looking at potential fraud, helping guests, helping hotels with overbookings, relocations, payment issues and of course - complaints. They do have very good information at hand via employee handbook and have a good system to easy acess it.","cons":"I believe the KPI's are not realistic. Booking wanted the calls to be short - under 6 minutes which is basically impossible if you are dealing with complaint or relocation. Short calls would make unhappy customers. Everyone was cheating to reach to KPIs. Personally I do believe that Booking.com are implementing new ideas and projects so fast that the information doesnt fully reach the CS agents and the accessable information is limited which makes it hard to actually reply anything. Since its a big company, its not flat and you feel like an ant with nothing to say or no interest whatsoever in you as an employee.","advice":"Every month, listen to some feedback from CS agents from different languages.","reviewer":"Customer Support Advisor","datetime":"2024-06-11T02:26:24.340","language":"en","id":"88136088","culture_and_values_rating":"3","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"3","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null}],"totals":{"review_count":8212,"filtered_reviews_count":6963,"average_rating":"4.1","overall_rating":"4.1","culture_and_values_rating":"4.2","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4.4","work_life_balance_rating":"4.2","senior_management_rating":"3.6","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4.1","career_opportunities_rating":"3.6","ceo_rating":"80%","business_outlook_rating":"75%","recommend_to_friend_rating":"83%"},"details":{"logo":null,"title":null}}
