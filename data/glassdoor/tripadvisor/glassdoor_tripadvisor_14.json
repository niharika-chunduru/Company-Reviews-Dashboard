The people culture is great with most being great fun &amp; willing to pitch in and pull together. My experience was that you have the opportunity to progress upwards or in to other roles, if you are proactive in reaching out across the business to learn more. The company focus on inclusion is really strong, some leaders dedicating real time to drive this across the culture of the business","cons":"The company can try to move fast for it's size- this can cause a breakdown in communications with a matrixed organisation and parallel teams. You have to be able to work around this and pivot quickly. In the last couple of years I felt there was some ambiguity around the business value prop/overall mission- making it less engaging for everyone without clear sight of what was trying to be achieved. European &amp; APAC based employees would often have to flex to adjust to American employee working hours- meant late nights most weeks","advice":"With a new CEO and several members of the leadership team, steer the ship to a clear view of the destination to give everyone a solid understanding of what they are striving to be. Potentially review some of the exisitng company cultures- perhaps Speed wins is not the best core value anymore.","reviewer":"Business Operations Director","datetime":"2023-06-19T02:14:18.627","language":"en","id":"77499602","culture_and_values_rating":"4","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"5","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"NEUTRAL","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW77459614.htm","rating":"4","title":"Great culture but too many layers","pros":"Flexible work hours, excellent benefits","cons":"Too many management changes and job scope can get too niche","advice":null,"reviewer":null,"datetime":"2023-06-16T20:02:19.663","language":"en","id":"77459614","culture_and_values_rating":"4","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"3","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"NO_OPINION","rating_business_outlook":"NEUTRAL","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW77434556.htm","rating":"3","title":"xxx","pros":"trying multi seiiion eeriit yjos","cons":"Easy to access life time free beautiful place nice services easy to easy","advice":"xxx","reviewer":"Sales","datetime":"2023-06-16T01:24:02.970","language":"en","id":"77434556","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null}],"totals":{"review_count":1503,"filtered_reviews_count":1216,"average_rating":"3.9","overall_rating":"3.9","culture_and_values_rating":"4.1","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4.2","work_life_balance_rating":"4","senior_management_rating":"3.4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"3.6","ceo_rating":"67%","business_outlook_rating":"53%","recommend_to_friend_rating":"79%"},"details":{"logo":null,"title":null}}
