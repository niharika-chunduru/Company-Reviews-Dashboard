https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW83232036.htm,1,A Regrettable Experience at Tripadvisor,Lifestyle benefit is a nice perk as well as the company shut down week between Christmas and New Years.,"I joined Tripadvisor with high hopes and enthusiasm, believing it would be a stepping stone for my career growth. However, my time at the company turned out to be the biggest regret of my professional life.

The company's primary focus appears to be solely on revenue, with little regard for the well-being of its employees or the satisfaction of its customers. The lack of value placed on both internal and external stakeholders is evident in every aspect of the organization.

One of the most glaring issues is the disorganized structure of the company. The communication and updates are shockingly poor, leaving employees in the dark about crucial information. Teams seem to lack passion for the business, resulting in a noticeable lack of desire to excel in their daily tasks.

The leadership team, unfortunately, is both inexperienced and unorganized. Their approach is not only tone-deaf but also sloppy, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued. A striking example of this is the insistence on full-time office attendance while leaders enjoy vacations in exotic locations such as the Bahamas, joining meetings remotely. This stark contrast in expectations and actions highlights the lack of empathy and understanding within the leadership team.

Communication breakdowns are rampant, with emails frequently ignored, and political games playing a significant role in day-to-day operations. This creates an unhealthy work environment, contributing to the overall dissatisfaction among employees.

The benefits package provided by Tripadvisor is severely lacking, causing numerous headaches and troubleshooting efforts. There is a palpable lack of trust in how commissions are calculated and paid out, further eroding confidence in the company's transparency and fairness. In addition their were hidden cliffs with in 401k and RSU options. The limited support given to teams and customers alike underscores the company's lack of commitment to their well-being.

In conclusion, my experience at Tripadvisor has been nothing short of disappointing. This move, which I had initially looked forward to the most in my career, turned out to be a profound letdown. I strongly caution anyone considering employment with or engaging in business with Tripadvisor to think twice. The company's prioritization of revenue over its people and customers, combined with its organizational and leadership issues, make it an undesirable place to work or collaborate with.",Put the customer first. ,Sales,2024-01-10T09:32:52.170,en,83232036,1,1,2,1,1,1,,False,DISAPPROVE,NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE
