The company needs fresh leaders with more energy who understands technology and travel. Direction is very unclear. Upper management is too busy competing with one another for top management’s attention and self promotion. As much as they claim to uphold diversity, the upper management is very much not diverse.","advice":"Listen to your employees more, especially the non-upper management — team who is on the ground, carrying out executional task. Set your direction loud and clear. It is really sad seeing the brand getting sluggish, slow, and obsolete. The name deteriorates and the platform is catered for boomers due to lack of fresh and modern ideas.","reviewer":null,"datetime":"2023-02-28T08:44:29.130","language":"en","id":"74058300","culture_and_values_rating":"3","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"2","work_life_balance_rating":"4","senior_management_rating":"1","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"1","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW74050664.htm","rating":"4","title":"Overall is good","pros":"many benefits fun people great brand name dynamic environment","cons":"Not many cons to mention so far","advice":null,"reviewer":"Account Manager","datetime":"2023-02-28T05:05:41.823","language":"en","id":"74050664","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW73959349.htm","rating":"5","title":"The people are great!","pros":"Great team, the benefits are good, the culture is super important for the company and the HR is helpful in so many ways","cons":"Salary is not attractive , the bonus is hard to achieve and the KPIs are not reasonable","advice":null,"reviewer":"Bussiness Development Executive","datetime":"2023-02-24T16:18:26.170","language":"en","id":"73959349","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"4","senior_management_rating":"5","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"3","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"APPROVE","rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW73949044.htm","rating":"3","title":"It’s ok","pros":"There are some great benefits","cons":"they don’t value longevity in employees or even try to keep up with the cost of living or inflation","advice":"Employees prefer monetary compensation rather than appreciation awards","reviewer":"Workforce Planner","datetime":"2023-02-24T09:38:03.120","language":"en","id":"73949044","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW73842367.htm","rating":"5","title":"Positive environment","pros":"Positive workplace, great work life balance and generous pay and benefits","cons":"TripAdvisor has tough competition with apps constantly coming up doing the same work","advice":null,"reviewer":"Senior Marketing Manager","datetime":"2023-02-21T13:48:29.597","language":"en","id":"73842367","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW73712656.htm","rating":"2","title":"Mean girls club","pros":"Great benefits!

These concerns have been brought to light by multiple people yet nothing has changed.
