I can't say that it's been like that for a few years now","cons":"HR, please take complaints of bullying, gaslighting and unfair treatment from leaders seriously. Pressure from leadership for teams to hit goals, also being labelled as \"holding people to account\", is NOT an excuse to treat people in unethical, disrespectful ways. Ironically, treating people like this actually doesn't motivate and promote better work, it just makes this a lose-lose hostile working environment.","advice":"Please please take employee's experiences seriously","reviewer":null,"datetime":"2024-08-27T12:22:30.210","language":"en","id":"90468358","culture_and_values_rating":"1","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"1","work_life_balance_rating":"1","senior_management_rating":"1","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"1","career_opportunities_rating":"1","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":"NEGATIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"NEGATIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW90461126.htm","rating":"5","title":"Company that really cares about their staff","pros":"From day one Tripadvisor looks after you, career development, welfare, and general wellbeing, It's a fast-paced environment so employee wellbeing is important.

There is a high intention that everbody get treated equally, no matter what kind of position. Even in a lower position you can always chat with colleagues who are in a \"higher rank\" (e.g. the CEO, greetings to Matt). You can be outward and don't have to worry about your nature, as long as you are kind. Good perfomance gets always rewarded and is seen! It's just a matter of persistency. If you work hard, you are motivated, and you like to exchange ideas with your colleagues, this is a nice place to be.","cons":"I think i can speak for everybody else that sometimes you go under among so many people when you feel stressed and restless. . You have to adapt to changes and be fast. If you are not willing to show the best side of you, you don't earn it to work here.","advice":"I am not sure if I could do it that better.
