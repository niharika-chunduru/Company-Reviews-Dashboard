There seemed to be a misalignment in priorities between focus areas and leadership often causing for excessive pivoting or work once deemed critical to be shelved. Once they tighten up the vision and take an unwavering approach to product development the sky is the limit.","advice":"Get focused and let the intelligent staff you hired have the creative space to fulfill the goals outlined for the year. Be okay with making strategic investments in something that may not pay dividends today, but will bare fruit for years to come if done correctly. You can't rush quality.","reviewer":"Senior Product Designer","datetime":"2023-09-18T08:29:37.520","language":"en","id":"80170123","culture_and_values_rating":"3","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"3","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"2","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"3","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"NO_OPINION","rating_business_outlook":"NEGATIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW80162343.htm","rating":"1","title":"to much pressure","pros":"good bonus if you sell. good benefits.","cons":"American company, doesnt care about HOW you sell, they only look at numbers.
