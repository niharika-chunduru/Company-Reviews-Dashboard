Tripadvisor employees are some of the most genuine, kind, and supportive group of individuals. Sr. leadership is very down-to-earth, and feedback and ideas are expected and encouraged from every level of the organization. I have to give a special shout out to people ops and talent acquisition who are an incredibly hard working and compassionate team-driven group. Benefits! The reviews don't lie folks. The benefits really are unmatchable, even compared to other large organizations. Flexibility, even within hybrid roles. This is especially true for working parents. For anyone with even a slight interest in travel, it's a FUN, ever-evolving industry. Learning and Development is strongly encouraged, and employee feedback is taken into consideration in many decisions across the org.","cons":"As with any large, global company- there are usually many layers to get things done. Sometimes, that makes it difficult to hold true ownership for projects/initiatives, especially when it impacts teams cross-functionally.","advice":null,"reviewer":"Talent Acquisition Specialist","datetime":"2023-03-24T09:25:29.113","language":"en","id":"74847272","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW74843990.htm","rating":"5","title":"You will be surrounded by very intelligent people","pros":"- Trips to US - Great perks","cons":"- Company still can't find its direction - Lots of redundancies in recent years","advice":null,"reviewer":"Senior Business Analyst","datetime":"2023-03-24T07:46:27.140","language":"en","id":"74843990","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW74812835.htm","rating":"4","title":"Great team","pros":"Very open and collaborative team","cons":"Not the best to grow career","advice":null,"reviewer":"Operations Engineer","datetime":"2023-03-23T10:25:13.523","language":"en","id":"74812835","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW74539888.htm","rating":"4","title":"Good Company, Lots of Changes","pros":"Good Culture, Bright Teammates, Great Industry","cons":"Don't expect to Travel in this role","advice":null,"reviewer":"Senior Business Development Executive","datetime":"2023-03-15T07:58:24.857","language":"en","id":"74539888","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW74350049.htm","rating":"5","title":"Good overall","pros":"People Benefits Relaxed environment Top managers","cons":"Outdated business approach Product irrelevant in todayâ€™s market","advice":"Secure your top people","reviewer":"Senior Sales Executive","datetime":"2023-03-09T07:29:13.910","language":"en","id":"74350049","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"5","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"5","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"}],"totals":{"review_count":1503,"filtered_reviews_count":1216,"average_rating":"3.9","overall_rating":"3.9","culture_and_values_rating":"4.1","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"4.2","work_life_balance_rating":"4","senior_management_rating":"3.4","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"3.6","ceo_rating":"67%","business_outlook_rating":"53%","recommend_to_friend_rating":"79%"},"details":{"logo":null,"title":null}}
