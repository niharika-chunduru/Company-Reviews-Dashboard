The perks of the office are also great...the headquarters is an amazing building with great offerings to give employees a good level of comfort. The people within the organization are truly what make it a great place, you learn from so many different people and always feel welcomed, even during/after a pandemic.","cons":"I think the company's values are kind of vague or generic and with new leadership, it's kind of a critical time to truly re-establish what direction things will go in. Not my experience directly but also it seems to be encouraged to work harder with limited resources over coming up with more solutions and the effects of that can be seen in re-orgs, layoffs, and teams generally being limited in resources.","advice":null,"reviewer":"IT Auditor","datetime":"2023-08-21T12:41:49.730","language":"en","id":"79340883","culture_and_values_rating":"4","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"3","work_life_balance_rating":"4","senior_management_rating":"2","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"4","career_opportunities_rating":"4","location":null,"is_current_job":false,"rating_ceo":"DISAPPROVE","rating_business_outlook":"POSITIVE","rating_recommend_to_friend":"POSITIVE"},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW79229659.htm","rating":"3","title":"Love it here","pros":"Fantastic place to work :)","cons":"Work life balance can be tough sometimes","advice":null,"reviewer":"Sales","datetime":"2023-08-17T06:59:32.343","language":"en","id":"79229659","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"3","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"3","career_opportunities_rating":"3","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":"NO_OPINION","rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW79065554.htm","rating":"4","title":"Great","pros":"Leadership commitment to ERGs, flexible work schedule, good pay.","cons":"Moves too quickly at times","advice":null,"reviewer":"Director","datetime":"2023-08-11T07:58:16.543","language":"en","id":"79065554","culture_and_values_rating":"0","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"0","work_life_balance_rating":"0","senior_management_rating":"0","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"0","career_opportunities_rating":"0","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW79003852.htm","rating":"4","title":"Good Company","pros":"Benefits Autonomy Being able to speak to upper level management anytime","cons":"Company and market headwinds are causing a lot of uncertainty about the future","advice":null,"reviewer":"Senior IT Manager","datetime":"2023-08-09T12:19:15.747","language":"en","id":"79003852","culture_and_values_rating":"4","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"3","work_life_balance_rating":"5","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"5","career_opportunities_rating":"5","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW78993243.htm","rating":"4","title":"No innovation","pros":"The company Culture is good","cons":"No innovation of product and services offered to Clients No career progression No full remote work","advice":null,"reviewer":"Business Development","datetime":"2023-08-09T07:22:32.763","language":"en","id":"78993243","culture_and_values_rating":"5","diversity_and_inclusion_rating":"3","work_life_balance_rating":"3","senior_management_rating":"3","compensation_and_benefits_rating":"3","career_opportunities_rating":"2","location":null,"is_current_job":true,"rating_ceo":null,"rating_business_outlook":null,"rating_recommend_to_friend":null},{"url":"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-M-RVW78863410.htm","rating":"4","title":"Wasn't the old good Tripadvisor anymore","pros":"The company still have good legacy and inclusive culture.
