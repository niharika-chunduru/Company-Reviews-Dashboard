New CEO hired a well known external consultancy at a huge cost and output was to be a 'mobile first' company. Senior management in certain BU are more interested in rewarding personal friendships then doing whats right for the business. Business pretends to be have a global approach but in reality is a US driven business that applies the same strategy globally. Text book US company behaviour.","advice":"Carry on replacing the old C suite and clear out the dead wood from Conde Nast.

The training was absolutely awful and did not set us up for success. Switch to a separate Business Development Rep and Account Executive model, rather than keeping those roles combined.
